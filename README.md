# ServerBot
Attempting to make a discord bot that let users interact with home server. At the time it only supports Minecraft server but it was made thinking of multiple server hosting. This implementation of the bot is made using Wake On Lan (WOL) to remotely (from the computer that is running this bot, that should be in the same network) turn on the server.

This bot was made with energy saving reasons in mind, but it also has some other extra features that will be shown bellow.

# Usage

## Live feedback from server!

This bot supports live feedback as a discord status. That means if there are players in the server, the bot status will change to reflect this.

The same will also happen when the server is turned off.

## Turn on and off a home server!

With this bot and certain Minecraft plugins, you can save your current position in the game and give it a name, so you can maybe return later.

## If no one is playing for a while, it automatically shuts down
